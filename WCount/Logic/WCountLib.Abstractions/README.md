## WCountLib Abstractions Library
This package adds interfaces to enable counting the number of lines, words, characters, and/or bytes in TextReader streams.

There is also an interface for determining what is a word, that can be used to assist in counting words.

No implementations are provided in this package - this is by design.

### Compatibility
This project should work with projects targeting .NET 8 or newer but support for edge cases or niche use cases is not guaranteed.

### Licensing
The WCount library is licensed under the MPL 2.0 license.
